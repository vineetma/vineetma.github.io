[IoT][1] is easy to get started.

[NEST][3] collects data and feeds it to [Firebase][4]. [Firebase][4] is also known as consolidation database.

REST, JSON are communication mechanism/formats for data exchange. IEEE1588 guides to make timestamps globally transferrable. Syncrhonizing timestamps is a biggest challenge in the IoT devices. This is required for historical analysis, trend spotting and time/frequency domain transformation.

Another area of concern is the [security][6] of data floating on internet which needs to be secured to avoid snooping and hijacking control systems of an environment.

What is impedance matching data in IoT? Impedance matching is understood to avoid reflection but what it is when "data" is added to it.

[What IoT brings][2]:

* Smart traffic control
* Smart parking
* Fleet management
* Remote vehicle control
* Road assistance
* Foods tracked for freshness and traceability
* Appliances run at optimum times, let you know when they need maintenance
* Monitoring air, water, soil conditions
* Earthquake and tsunami early-warning systems
* Monitoring structural conditions
* Smart Grid
* Movements of wildlife
* Dynamic response to product demands
* Intelligent shopping systems
* Smart heating and cooling systems

"A Smart City is a city where the goal is to link every device and service to an information network through wireless networking, RFID tags and sensors. Songdo, South Korea and Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City are examples." Quoted in [What IoT Brings?][2]

[IoT][1] brings lot of resource references to develop own's knowledge
