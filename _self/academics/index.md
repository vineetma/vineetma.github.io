Vineet finished his PGPM ( [Post Graduate Program In Management - Part Time](http://www.mdi.ac.in/executive-post-graduate-programmes/part-time-post-graduate-programme-in-management.html), AICTE approved) from M.D.I. Gurgaon in 2013 March. [36 subjects](thirty-six-subjects.html) with every subject having 30 contact hours. He did his major in Marketing and minor in Finance.

He earned Gold Medal in this course. His dissertation was on consumer behaviour for online purchase.

He was in job for [16 years](../careers) and left it to experiment with entrepreneurship. Unfortunately, it did not workout, the way he had seen it. Doing MBA, was a challenging not very optimistic scenario. Strict discipline at college, rigorous course execution, late evening hours classes, all contributed to bring in useful transformation and developed a perspective to doing business.

He had earlier attempted the same course in 1999, 2003 and had to leave it in between, giving priority to job and family at that time. This time, it was family and studies.

Some of the [pearls of wisdom](pearls-of-wisdom.html) can be see here. These are collected from classes of respected professors, who were great in delivering the knowledge and connecting us with business realities through case studies, workshops, guest lectures, project work besides academic activities of quiz/exams.

###Six Sigma Black Belt - Training
Vineet, in 2010, opted for 12-days course with QAI to get trained on Six Sigma. He had strong believe in processes and their role to make a self-sustaining organization with continuous improvements. Processes when understood in detail, have dependency on metrics and statistical analysis. This is where, he found Six Sigma an enabler for any future application. He has interest in Statistics which also aligns well with this need. Learnt this again while he studied at MDI.
