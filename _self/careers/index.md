#Delta Hamlin Pvt. Ltd. 
Vineet, started his career with Delta Hamlin Pvt. Ltd. (a subsidary of <a href="http://www.cdil.com/">C.D.I.L.</a>). It was a campus placement. He started there to explore hardware circuits of Washing Machine, as is faintly recalled by him. Later, looking at the potential, seniors moved him to design division and work with headoffice to learn new tools in CAD for components design. After 3 months of association, call from Punjab Communications Limited (later known as PunCom), Mohali (near Chandigarh), came for joining. He joined there as Design Engineer. Interviews had already taken place during campus, but appointment was on hold.

#Punjab Communications Limited
In PunCom, he was inducted in production department and put on repair of SMPS power supplies. In college days, he and his friend Puneet had done several projects from small lab setup at their homes and continued to develop that passion, irrespective of work at office. He had special interest and liking towards automation, embedded and hence software. He had learnt C++, Assembly languages in college and was looking eagerly to apply those concepts in office projects. After a successful month of repair / understanding of SMPS at production floor, digital / software background came to knowledge of managers of design function and he was transferred there for working on CNC automation software, for which hardware was already assembled.

With proven skills and maturity in taking design activities further, the duo were assigned some more challenging tasks in embedded and software, in the field of supervisory control for Radio Telecommunications Network. Mr. Ajay Jain, manager at that time, who identified opportunities and trusted him to work on projects. As time passed away, more complex projects were done. VSAT control system (hub and spoke), 16+1 modem redudnancy management system. Enhanced supervisory (without a need of terminal) was developed.

During this journey at PunCom for 3 years, he developed an excellent knowledge base and experience in the field of electronics design, embedded software, logic analyzer. However, fate something else to show up. During 1994, electronics, as is used to be called elite profession, was not generating enough jobs in India. This has caused, engineers either to fled away to US or switch profession to pure software play Or go for higher studies. 

##Embarking on pure software journey
Vineet, also got an opportunity at this point to switch to Hughes Software Systems (now called as Aricent Technologies) in May 1997. It was at this time, he moved out of Chandigarh for the first time, alone. Hughes had not considered past experience of much relevance to their ongoing projects. They caught on his programming skills, during interview, he believe.

#Hughes Software Systems (now known as Aricent Technologies)
It was a great beginning, specifically moving out of a public sector in those days to an MNC was a dream come true. Attraction of Hughes was primarily for the way they take care of their employees, their career and the cutting-edge technologies. To him, it was a next step on where he left PunCom. Leaving PunCom was extremely tough, due to long association and challenging projects core to his engineering education. It was further made difficult by the complex relieving process, which had gone through rough patches for over 2 years.
