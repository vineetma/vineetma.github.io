#Delta Hamlin Pvt. Ltd. (Jun 1994 till Sep 1994) 
Vineet, started his career with Delta Hamlin Pvt. Ltd. (a subsidary of <a href="http://www.cdil.com/">C.D.I.L.</a>). It was a campus placement. He started there to explore hardware circuits of Washing Machine, as is faintly recalled by him. Later, looking at the potential, seniors moved him to design division and work with headoffice to learn new tools in CAD for components design. After 3 months of association, call from Punjab Communications Limited (later known as PunCom), Mohali (near Chandigarh), came for joining. He joined there as Design Engineer. Interviews had already taken place during campus, but appointment was on hold.

In PunCom, he was inducted in production department and put on repair of SMPS power supplies. In college days, he and his friend Puneet had done several projects from small lab setup at their homes and continued to develop that passion, irrespective of work at office. He had special interest and liking towards automation, embedded and hence software. He had learnt C++, Assembly languages in college and was looking eagerly to apply those concepts in office projects. After a successful month of repair / understanding of SMPS at production floor, digital / software background came to knowledge of managers of design function and he was transferred there for working on CNC automation software, for which hardware was already assembled.

With proven skills and maturity in taking design activities further, the duo were assigned some more challenging tasks in embedded and software, in the field of supervisory control for Radio Telecommunications Network.

As time passed away, more complex projects were done. VSAT control system (hub and spoke), 16+1 modem redudnancy management system. Enhanced supervisory (without a need of terminal) was developed.

During this journey at PunCom for 3 years, he developed an excellent knowledge base and experience in the field of electronics design, embedded software, use of complex instruments like logic analyzer, spectrum analyzer, new technology areas like xDSL, SNMP, CMIP etc. However, fate had something else to show up. During 1994, electronics, as is used to be called elite profession, was not generating enough jobs in India. This has caused, engineers either to fled away to US or switch profession to pure software play Or go for higher studies. 

##Embarking on pure software journey
Vineet, also got an opportunity at this point to switch to Hughes Software Systems (now called as Aricent Technologies) in May 1997. It was at this time, he moved out of Chandigarh for the first time, alone. Hughes had not considered past experience of much relevance to their ongoing projects. They caught on his programming skills, during interview, he believe.

It was a great beginning, specifically moving out of a public sector in those days to an MNC was a dream come true. Attraction of Hughes was primarily for the way they take care of their employees, their career and the cutting-edge technologies. To him, it was a next step on where he left PunCom. Leaving PunCom was extremely tough, due to long association and challenging projects core to his engineering education. It was further made difficult by the complex relieving process, which had gone through rough patches for over 2 years.

##Embarking on entrepreneurial journey
After working for 16 years in corporates, it was a moment of self-realisation. He felt, that if he works on his own outside these boundaries, probably can do more and help in bringing in much needed transformation to way of working in corporate world. It was a time, he felt to bring in optimzation. Any industry, after these many years of work, can not justify working with higher cost structures and doing traditional way of service projects. One has to move up the chain with lean mindset. One needs to experiment and get out of the comfort zone before being kicked out.

He has seen this Industry going from the good old days of 1990s where employee was king, to late 2010s where employee and Indian software companies die to get work and work more like slaves. This has been a time, as well, where Indian education also saw drastic decline / expansion. It had confused talent with the abundant supply of degree holders. Somewhere, learning has given way to the daily sustenance. Hiring for talent has started being replaced with references culture. 5% top layer grew to 15%. 8-10 years of maturity was replaced with 3-5 years for project managers job(and the trend continues till now in 2015, even more pronounced). It is need of the hour for corporates to re-invent themselves, where they create small cells of entrepreneurs, do profit sharing, create principles of doing business, promote innovation in every field that affects them.

Not many opportunities were available and have been cut-off from friends, by his nature, finding a suitable job elsewhere was a remote chance. He got few options, but by that time, his mind to bootstrap his own work had firmed up.
