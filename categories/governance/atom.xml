    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To start writing this, an old adage is most apt to describe it - “Jaisa raja waisee praja” (as is the king, so are the people). Debate is can it is said in reverse order - as are the people so is the king? Yes, one may argue, it is the people only who make choice, good or worse. But is it that such choice could create a great nation. My answer is “No”. Being elected is one thing, delivering governance is another.</p>

<p>Motivation of this subject came from</p>

<p>Pull some quotes from Chanakya Neeti
Comparison of Gurgaon v/s Chandigarh and difference of years
Pull how Ashoka had planned, if available..
What Devdutt has to say about, this culture
How does competence play an important role here?</p>
