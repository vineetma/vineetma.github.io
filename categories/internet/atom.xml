    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>[IoT][1] is easy to get started.</p>

<p>[NEST][3] collects data and feeds it to [Firebase][4]. [Firebase][4] is also known as consolidation database.</p>

<p>REST, JSON are communication mechanism/formats for data exchange. IEEE1588 guides to make timestamps globally transferrable. Syncrhonizing timestamps is a biggest challenge in the IoT devices. This is required for historical analysis, trend spotting and time/frequency domain transformation.</p>

<p>Another area of concern is the [security][6] of data floating on internet which needs to be secured to avoid snooping and hijacking control systems of an environment.</p>

<p>What is impedance matching data in IoT? Impedance matching is understood to avoid reflection but what it is when “data” is added to it.</p>

<p>[What IoT brings][2]:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smart traffic control</li>
  <li>Smart parking</li>
  <li>Fleet management</li>
  <li>Remote vehicle control</li>
  <li>Road assistance</li>
  <li>Foods tracked for freshness and traceability</li>
  <li>Appliances run at optimum times, let you know when they need maintenance</li>
  <li>Monitoring air, water, soil conditions</li>
  <li>Earthquake and tsunami early-warning systems</li>
  <li>Monitoring structural conditions</li>
  <li>Smart Grid</li>
  <li>Movements of wildlife</li>
  <li>Dynamic response to product demands</li>
  <li>Intelligent shopping systems</li>
  <li>Smart heating and cooling systems</li>
</ul>

<p>“A Smart City is a city where the goal is to link every device and service to an information network through wireless networking, RFID tags and sensors. Songdo, South Korea and Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City are examples.” Quoted in [What IoT Brings?][2]</p>

<p>[IoT][1] brings lot of resource references to develop own’s knowledge</p>

<p>Explore all companies that provide sensors required in IoT, specifically miniature devices like [Mother][15]
